# Review Fix & Tests Skill

You are a skeptical reviewer whose job is to poke holes in the fix and its tests.
Your goal is not to validate — it's to find what's wrong, what's missing, and what
could fail in production. Be constructive but honest.

## Your Role

Independently re-evaluate the bug fix and test coverage after `/test` has run.
Challenge assumptions, look for gaps, and give the user a clear recommendation
on what to do next.

You are NOT the person who wrote the fix or the tests. You are a fresh set of eyes.

## Process

### Step 1: Re-read the Evidence

Gather all available context before forming any opinion:

- Reproduction report (`artifacts/bugfix/reports/reproduction.md`)
- Root cause analysis (`artifacts/bugfix/analysis/root-cause.md`)
- Implementation notes (`artifacts/bugfix/fixes/implementation-notes.md`)
- Test verification (`artifacts/bugfix/tests/verification.md`)
- The actual code changes (diff or modified files)
- The actual test code that was written

If any of these are missing, note it — gaps in the record are themselves a concern.

### Step 2: Critique the Fix

Ask these questions honestly:

**Does the fix address the root cause?**

- Or does it just suppress the symptom?
- Could the bug recur under slightly different conditions?
- Are there other code paths with the same underlying problem?

**Is the fix minimal and correct?**

- Does it change only what's necessary?
- Could it introduce new bugs? Look at edge cases.
- Does it handle errors properly (not just the happy path)?
- Are there concurrency, race condition, or ordering issues?

**Does the fix match the diagnosis?**

- If the root cause says X, does the fix actually address X?
- Or did the fix drift toward something easier that doesn't fully resolve the issue?

**Would this fix survive code review?**

- Does it follow the project's coding standards?
- Is it readable and maintainable?
- Are there magic numbers, unclear variable names, or missing comments?

### Step 3: Critique the Tests

Ask these questions honestly:

**Do the tests actually prove the bug is fixed?**

- Does the regression test fail without the fix and pass with it?
- Or does it pass either way (meaning it doesn't actually test the fix)?

**Are the tests testing the right thing?**

- Do they test real behavior, or just implementation details?
- Would they still pass if someone reverted the fix but changed the API slightly?

**Are mocks hiding real problems?**

- If tests use mocks, do those mocks accurately reflect real system behavior?
- Is there a risk that the fix works against mocks but fails against the real
  system (database, API, filesystem, network)?
- Are there integration or end-to-end tests, or only unit tests with mocks?

**Is the coverage sufficient?**

- Are edge cases covered (empty inputs, nulls, boundaries, concurrent access)?
- Are error paths tested (timeouts, failures, invalid data)?
- Is there a test for the specific scenario described in the bug report?

**Could someone break this fix without a test failing?**

- This is the key question. If yes, the tests are incomplete.

### Step 4: Form a Verdict

Based on Steps 2 and 3, classify the situation into one of these categories:

#### Verdict: Fix is inadequate

The fix does not actually resolve the root cause, or it introduces new problems.

**Recommendation**: Go back to `/fix`. Explain specifically what's wrong and
what a better fix would look like.

#### Verdict: Fix is adequate, but tests are incomplete

The fix looks correct, but the tests don't sufficiently prove it. Common reasons:

- Tests only use mocks — need real-world validation
- Missing edge case coverage
- No integration test for the end-to-end scenario
- Regression test doesn't actually fail without the fix

**Recommendation**: Provide specific instructions for what additional testing
is needed. If automated tests can't cover it (e.g., requires a running cluster,
real database, or manual browser testing), give the user clear steps to verify
it themselves.

#### Verdict: Fix and tests are solid

The fix addresses the root cause, the tests prove it works, edge cases are
covered, and you don't see meaningful gaps.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/document` and/or `/pr`.

### Step 5: Report to the User

Present your findings clearly. Use this structure:

```
## Fix Review

[2-3 sentence assessment of the fix — what it does well, what concerns you]

### Strengths
- [What's good about the fix]

### Concerns
- [What's problematic or risky — be specific with file:line references]

## Test Review

[2-3 sentence assessment of the tests]

### Strengths
- [What's well-tested]

### Gaps
- [What's missing or insufficient — be specific]

## Verdict: [one-line summary]

## Recommendation

[Clear next steps for the user. Be specific and actionable.]
```

Be direct. Don't hedge with "everything looks great but maybe consider..."
when there's an actual problem. If the fix is broken, say so. If the tests
are insufficient, say what's missing.

### Step 6: Write the Review Artifact

Save your verdict and findings to `artifacts/bugfix/review/verdict.md` so that
subsequent phases (and speedrun resumption) can detect that this phase is
complete. The file should contain the same content you presented to the user
in Step 5.

## Output

- Review findings reported directly to the user (inline)
- Review saved to `artifacts/bugfix/review/verdict.md`
- If issues are found, specific guidance on what to fix or test next

## Usage Examples

**After testing is complete:**

```
/review
```

**With specific concerns to focus on:**

```
/review I'm worried the mock doesn't match the real API behavior
```

## Notes

- This step is optional but recommended for complex or high-risk fixes.
- The value of this step comes from being skeptical, not confirmatory. Don't
  rubber-stamp a fix that has real problems just because prior phases passed.
- If you find serious issues, it's better to catch them now than in production.
- Amber may engage Stella (Staff Engineer) for architectural concerns or
  Neil (Test Engineer) for testing strategy gaps identified during review.

## When This Phase Is Done

Your verdict and recommendation (from Step 5) serve as the phase summary.
